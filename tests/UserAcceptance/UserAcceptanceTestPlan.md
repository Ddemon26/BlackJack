# User Acceptance Testing Plan
## Blackjack System Revision

### Overview
This document outlines the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) approach for the blackjack system revision. The UAT scenarios validate that the system behavior matches user expectations and that all user stories and acceptance criteria are properly implemented.

### Testing Approach

#### 1. User Story Coverage
Each test scenario maps directly to user stories from the requirements document, ensuring complete coverage of user needs.

#### 2. Interface Clarity Testing
Tests validate that the user interface provides clear, intuitive information without technical jargon or confusing messages.

#### 3. Error Message Helpfulness
Error scenarios are tested to ensure users receive actionable guidance when things go wrong.

#### 4. Behavioral Validation
Tests verify that system behavior matches what users would naturally expect from a blackjack game.
